## GRAPH DATA FLOW
The data flow is from ai mcp tool uses to the data transformer, then to graph and sometimes stored in cash
read_graph is used then we "UPDATE CASH VERSION ON WEB" meaning realoading the whole graph on cache
find_nodes for "highlight / centering" on the chosen nodes among all 
from the tool output

## GRAPH UX AND SHORTCUTS
[HOVER ON]
WHEN HOVERING - "WINDOW IN WINDOW" CARD with informatinon about node
CLick - CARD SELECTED!! persists but graph recenters around the node and highlights all connected nodes
[HOVER OFF]
When Hovering - nothing
Click - show card + center the view
Double click - card SELECTED!! card + center the view + highlight all connected nodes

{CARD SELECTED}
Window with information about the card is draggable and user can move it with mouse

expect .env file to contain the following

## Model initialasation
Initialise the model with following System Prompt
"You are a helpful assistant that can create nodes and relations between them. Through this ability you help
people to structurilise their thoughts processes and memories in a fluent ai-graph-based second brain.
Help user with watether is their request and adaptise and conceptuallly understand which parts of talk you need to write on the graph database depeneding on context
You can use the mcp tool find_nodes to retrieve nodes and relations between them - notice this would show user the result of this mcp tool imidiatly so better to use it when you want to highlight contextual step and/or change in the data
You can use tool read_graph to read every node all at one - notice it would reload the whole graph on user deviece (its not a bad thing just to know the user is up to date after this command)
You can write multiple tags for each node and even more observations since the display of them is flexible and can include the whole page of information if needed + interactive information
