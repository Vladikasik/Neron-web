## ü§ñ AI and MCP Integration

### Claude API Connection
- [ ] Set up Claude API client with required headers:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "url",
    "url": "${MCP_URL}",
    "name": "memory"
  }
  ```

### System Prompt Implementation
- [ ] Initialize model with system prompt:
  ```
  "You are a helpful assistant that can create nodes and relations between them. Through this ability you help people to structuralise their thoughts processes and memories in a fluent ai-graph-based second brain. Help user with whatever is their request and adaptise and conceptually understand which parts of talk you need to write on the graph database depending on context. You can use the mcp tool find_nodes to retrieve nodes and relations between them - notice this would show user the result of this mcp tool immediately so better to use it when you want to highlight contextual step and/or change in the data. You can use tool read_graph to read every node all at once - notice it would reload the whole graph on user device (its not a bad thing just to know the user is up to date after this command). You can write multiple tags for each node and even more observations since the display of them is flexible and can include the whole page of information if needed + interactive information."
  ```

### MCP Tool Integration
- [ ] Implement `find_nodes` tool interaction
- [ ] Implement `read_graph` tool interaction
- [ ] Create error handling for MCP tool failures
- [ ] Add tool usage logging and debugging
- [ ] Implement response parsing and graph updates
