# Neron Graph Visualization Project - TODO List

## Project Overview
React-based 3D graph visualization with AI-powered MCP integration featuring interactive node exploration and AI-driven second brain functionality. Built with react-force-graph-3d, Shadcn UI (Mono theme), and Claude API integration.

---

## âœ… COMPLETED

### Project Initialization
- [x] Initialize React project with Vite
- [x] Install core dependencies (react-force-graph-3d, @shadcn/ui, lucide-react, tailwindcss)
- [x] Configure Shadcn UI with Mono theme
- [x] Integrate Matrix-style colors and effects
- [x] Set up Vercel deployment configuration
- [x] Configure TypeScript for type safety
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier

### MCP Integration - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH âœ…
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Enhanced system prompt to force MCP tool usage
- [x] **AUTO-GRAPH UPDATES**: Added automatic graph reload when read_graph tool succeeds
- [x] **AUTO-NODE HIGHLIGHTING**: Added automatic node highlighting when find_nodes tool succeeds
- [x] **RESPONSE PROCESSING**: Added comprehensive MCP tool result processing
- [x] **EVENT SYSTEM**: Implemented custom events for graph updates (mcpGraphReload, mcpNodeHighlight)
- [x] **DEBUGGING**: Enhanced MCP tool detection and logging system
- [x] **TOOL VALIDATION**: Added validation for all 11 MCP tools
- [x] Set up Claude API client with proper MCP headers
- [x] Configure model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 with MCP beta features

### Graph Visualization Core
- [x] Install and configure react-force-graph-3d
- [x] Set up 3D scene with proper lighting and camera controls
- [x] Implement responsive graph sizing
- [x] Create sample graph data structure
- [x] Add zoom controls and graph interactions

### Console System
- [x] Create draggable console component
- [x] Add console toggle button with Matrix styling
- [x] Implement real-time message display
- [x] Add console history and auto-scroll
- [x] Stream AI responses to console
- [x] Add MCP tool usage logging

### Node Interaction System
- [x] Implement hover functionality with information cards
- [x] Add single click: show card + center view
- [x] Add double click: persistent selection + highlight connections
- [x] Create draggable information cards
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts (H for hover mode, / for console)

## ðŸš€ IN PROGRESS

### MCP System Enhancement
- [ ] **URGENT**: Fix system prompt to guarantee MCP tool usage (current: AI sometimes responds with text only)
- [ ] Add retry mechanism when AI doesn't use MCP tools
- [ ] Implement tool usage enforcement with validation
- [ ] Add MCP server health monitoring
- [ ] Create MCP tool usage analytics

### Project Structure Storage (NEO4J)
- [ ] **NEW**: Store project roadmap and progress in NEO4J knowledge graph
- [ ] **NEW**: Track completed tasks and current focus areas
- [ ] **NEW**: Evolve project structure handling without overwriting old data
- [ ] **NEW**: Scale data handling to maintain monoblock project structure
- [ ] **NEW**: Log all project changes and evolution in graph

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PRIORITIES

### Critical MCP Fixes
1. **System Prompt Refinement**: Make AI ALWAYS use MCP tools
2. **Tool Usage Validation**: Reject responses without MCP tool usage
3. **Graph Cache Management**: Ensure cache updates on successful tool results
4. **Error Recovery**: Handle cases where MCP tools fail

### Graph Data Flow Enhancement
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Add cache invalidation logic
- [ ] Create data validation and error handling
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for large graphs

### UI Polish
- [ ] Add subtle Matrix-style animations
- [ ] Implement glowing borders and effects
- [ ] Create loading states for MCP operations
- [ ] Add visual feedback for successful tool usage

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement search and filter capabilities
- [ ] Add graph export/import functionality
- [ ] Create node templates and quick creation
- [ ] Add collaboration features

---

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DEBT

### TypeScript Issues
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript type issues with MCP responses
- [ ] Add proper typing for graph data structures
- [ ] Resolve component prop type warnings

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize graph rendering for large datasets
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for console
- [ ] Add lazy loading for node information
- [ ] Bundle size optimization

### Testing
- [ ] Set up unit tests for MCP integration
- [ ] Create integration tests for graph operations
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT STATUS

**Project Health**: ðŸŸ¢ Good
**MCP Integration**: ðŸŸ¡ Partially Working (needs tool usage enforcement)
**Graph Visualization**: ðŸŸ¢ Working
**Console System**: ðŸŸ¢ Working
**Node Interactions**: ðŸŸ¢ Working

**Environment Setup**: 
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: âœ… Configured
- MCP_URL: âœ… https://memory.aynshteyn.dev/sse
- Deployment: âœ… Vercel configured

**Key Issue**: AI responds with text instead of using MCP tools consistently. Need to force tool usage.

**Next Session Focus**: Fix MCP tool usage enforcement and add NEO4J project tracking.
